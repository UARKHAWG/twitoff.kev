# Twitoff Project Building a full-stack application, backed by Data Science 
# Fitting a predictive model based on Tweet embeddings, and allow the client to use the model to make predictions of which user is more likely to tweet given text.

* Web Application Development with Flask
* Create a simple Python web application that exposes an API to URL endpoints
* Connect to the NotTwitter API and query for tweets by various parameters
* Implement a SpaCy NLP model to create embeddings from our tweet text.
* Adding Data Science to a Web Application
* Run and report simple online analysis of data from the user or an API
* Run a more complicated offline model, and serialize the results for online use
* Deploy a basic (single-server) web application to common cloud services
* Securely connect a deployed web application to a relational database back-end
